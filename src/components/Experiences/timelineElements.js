I learnt how a startup company works, and the different roles each employee plays. I was assigned to look for potential Web3 communities within universities and schools, and I pitched social media marketing to them. Overall, it was an eye opening experience, one where I might be unable to find anywhere else.",

This position taught me a lot of important values and skills, such as managing a performance, and dealing with troublemakers, along with how to lead a CCA. Although I was only Captain for 1 year before I had to step down, I hosted and directed many events, such as the Staff Appreciation Week performance 2022 and 2023, where I choreographed the performance along with the vice-captains, along with ADay@SST, a open house where I went around to attract people to our booth, and CCA Fair 2023 and 2024. Because of our efforts,the amount of new members in Taekwondo drastically increased, from less than 10 people in my batch, to over 20 new members in 2023, and more to come in 2024.",
